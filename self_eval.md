# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
  * Very!
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
  * Also very!
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
  * Same as above!
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
  * Maybe two hours? It was about what I was expecting
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * I feel like theres a lot of tricks that I have yet to pick up and which will make things go much faster. I've already learned some from my teammates, so that's a good option! and no, no adjustments needed.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * I put some kinda fun stuff in the code to entertain myself and also whoever goes over this. I know its not sustainable long term, but is that fine for now? Is it obnoxious/unprofessional? Feel free to let me know if I should stop
